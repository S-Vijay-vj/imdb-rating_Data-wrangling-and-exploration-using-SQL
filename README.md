IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is a website that provides reviews, ratings, and other information about movies and TV shows. The IMDb rating system allows users to rate movies and TV shows on a scale of 1 to 10. These ratings are then used to calculate the overall IMDb rating for a movie or TV show, which is an average of all the ratings given by users.

Here, a dataset consisting of IMDB ratings of over 10000 movies and TV shows is being cleaned and explored in **PostgreSQL**.
